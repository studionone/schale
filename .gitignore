/tests/coverage/*

#
# Ignore the contents of various logs directories... except for the
# .gitkeep files which ensures they exist.
#
/tests/logs/*
/tests/.phpunit.result.cache

#
# Make an exception for .gitkeep files. This lets us use a .gitkeep file
# to create directories which we need to exist, but ignore the rest of
# the contents of the directory.
#
# For example, /code/app/logs/ needs to exist, and so contains a
# .gitkeep file. But we don't want git to track the individual log files
# in that directory.
#
# This must be last, so it overrides the more general ignore lines
# above.
